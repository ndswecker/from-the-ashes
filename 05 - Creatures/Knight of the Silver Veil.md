## Special Traits
**Aura of Dominion.**  
Allied creatures of the Hegemony within 10 feet of the knight have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

**Silver Veil Discipline.**  
The knight has advantage on saving throws to resist charm, fear, or attempts to read or influence its thoughts.

**Equipment.**  
The knight wears a **Bracer of Dominance**, allowing it to command enslaved creatures wearing slave collars.

---

## Actions
**Multiattack.**  
The knight makes two melee attacks.

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Command the Slave (Bonus Action).**  
The knight targets a creature wearing a slave collar within 60 feet and makes a Charisma check with a **+12 bonus** (+10 from the Bracer of Dominance, +2 from its Charisma modifier).  
On a **22 or higher**, the target is compelled and must use its next turn to take the **Attack** action against a creature the knight chooses. A compelled creature cannot be forced to harm itself.  
On a failure, the creature resists, and the knight cannot use this ability on that creature again until its next turn.

---

## Reactions
**Parry.**  
The knight adds +2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

---

## Description & Lore
Knights of the Silver Veil form the disciplined military aristocracy of the **Jehovah’s Hegemony of Greater Idaho**. Chosen from childhood for obedience and brutality, they undergo indoctrination rituals that strip them of fear and doubt.

Their signature artifact—the **Bracer of Dominance**—allows them to command enslaved creatures who wear the paired slave collar. These knights are often placed in charge of labor camps, forward raids, or elite detachments where absolute control is required.

They believe themselves chosen by Jehovah to bring dominion to the post-apocalyptic world.

## DM Notes
- Best used as an elite miniboss or lieutenant in Hegemony operations.  
- The Command ability should be used early and aggressively, especially if controlling a beloved NPC like LRG.  
- Combine with 2–3 Hegemony Scouts for a deadly encounter.  
- The Bracer of Dominance **should not function for players** without corruption, attunement rituals, or consequences.
