# NPCs — Elven Camp at Yakima River

These three NPCs are present at the Elven forward camp near the Yakima River crossing (Howard’s Way Trailhead) prior to the dawn vanguard attack.

They are designed to:
- Survive initial mistakes
- Contribute meaningfully in combat
- Die only if neglected or deliberately sacrificed

One or more may die depending on player choices.

## Aelthryn Silverbough
**Role:** Elven Healer  
**Faction:** Elvensworth  
**Disposition:** Compassionate, resolute, self-sacrificing  

### Description
Aelthryn is slight even by elven standards, with ash-blonde hair bound back in practical braids. Her hands are almost always stained with blood or crushed herbs. She wears layered travel robes reinforced with subtle ward-threading, but no armor.

She moves calmly even in crisis.

### Background
Aelthryn trained in Elvensworth’s lower sanctuaries, tending refugees and survivors of raids. She volunteered for Ellensburg after remembering when elves were the ones begging for shelter.

She believes refusing aid is how wars rot the soul.

### Combat Profile
- **AC:** 13  
- **HP:** 20  
- **Good Save:** Wisdom +4  

### Actions (Choose One per Round)

**Stabilize & Mend (Support)**  
- A creature within 5 ft regains **1d6 HP**
- Unconscious creatures are automatically stabilized
- Usable **twice per combat**

**Ward Pulse (Reaction, 1/round)**  
- When an ally within 10 ft is hit, reduce damage by **1d6**

**Desperate Dagger (Attack)**  
- +4 to hit, **1d4+2** damage  
- Used only if cornered

### Death Threshold
The first time Aelthryn would drop to 0 HP:
- She instead drops to **1 HP** and falls prone  
- Subsequent drops kill her normally

## Commander Thalanor Reedscar
**Role:** Veteran Elven Officer  
**Faction:** Elvensworth  
**Disposition:** Disciplined, blunt, pragmatic  

### Description
Thalanor is elderly, his armor scarred and repaired countless times. A long facial scar pulls his expression into a permanent scowl. He walks with a staff but still carries a sword.

He commands through experience, not volume.

### Background
Thalanor fought during the early expansions of the Hegemony, coordinating evacuations and rear-guard actions. He understands human cities and street fighting better than most elven officers.

He should have retired years ago. He refused.

### Combat Profile
- **AC:** 15  
- **HP:** 24  
- **Good Save:** Constitution +4  

### Actions (Choose One per Round)

**Measured Strike (Attack)**  
- +5 to hit, **1d8+3** damage

**Hold the Line (Command)**  
Choose one ally within 10 ft:
- +2 AC until Thalanor’s next turn  
  **or**
- Advantage on their next opportunity attack

**Tactical Intercept (Reaction)**  
- When an enemy moves past him, Thalanor may move 5 ft and make one attack

### Physical Limitation
If Thalanor dashes, climbs, or is knocked prone:
- He has **disadvantage on attacks next round**

## Caleb Morrell
**Role:** Volunteer Defender  
**Faction:** Ellensburg Civilian Militia  
**Disposition:** Earnest, frightened, determined  

### Description
Caleb is young, barely old enough to shave properly. His armor doesn’t fit quite right. His grip on his spear is too tight, and his eyes are always tracking threats a moment too late.

He is terrified — and refusing to run.

### Background
Caleb grew up in west Ellensburg. His family owns a repair shop near the river. He volunteered after his mother refused to evacuate and his sister went into hiding.

He does not hate the Hegemony. He hates that they came here.

### Combat Profile
- **AC:** 14  
- **HP:** 18  
- **Good Save:** Dexterity +4  

### Actions (Choose One per Round)

**Guarded Thrust (Attack)**  
- +4 to hit, **1d6+2** damage  
- Gain advantage if adjacent to a PC

**Covering Defense (Support)**  
Choose one adjacent ally:
- Advantage on their next save vs fear  
  **or**
- +2 AC against the next attack

**Panic Surge (Triggered)**  
If an ally drops to 0 HP nearby:
- Caleb may move half speed and make one attack
- He has disadvantage on his next roll

### Morale Check
If Caleb is:
- reduced below half HP
- isolated from allies
- or witnesses an NPC death

He must succeed a **DC 12 Wisdom save** or:
- freeze (lose next action)
- or retreat 10 ft toward safety

A PC can negate this automatically with reassurance.

---

## DM Guidance

- These NPCs should **draw danger**, not absorb it endlessly
- Saving all three should feel difficult but possible
- Losing one should alter later encounters and morale
- Survivors should recur; deaths should be remembered

They are not heroes.

They are why this battle matters.
