# Encounter Overview
As the party descends through **Shushuskin Valley**, the destruction of Abimelech’s binding has awakened the dead.  
Centuries of corpses buried beneath the canyon floor begin to **burst upward**—hands, arms, skulls, and torsos clawing from the soil.

The banshees are awake.  
They are **not here to fight**.

This encounter is about **movement, survival, and momentum**. If the party is delayed too long, the banshees will close the distance and unleash their wail.

---

## Encounter Structure

- **Players roll initiative**
- **No monsters roll initiative**
- Undead hazards are assumed to be **everywhere**
- Each round represents frantic movement through grasping terrain
- The encounter ends when the party reaches safety at the valley exit

---

## Environmental Hazard — Grasping Dead

The entire encounter area counts as:
- **Difficult terrain**
- **Undead-infested ground**

These undead are stationary and do not move or pursue.

---

## Grasping Check (Each Turn)

Each round, **when a PC moves through the area**, they must make **one check** to avoid being grabbed.

**Avoid the Grasp**
- **DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics)** *or* **Strength (Athletics)**
- Success:  
  - The PC moves normally (subject to difficult terrain)
- Failure:  
  - The PC is **grappled**
  - Speed becomes **0**
  - The PC takes **1d4 necrotic damage**

Only **one grapple attempt per PC per round**.

---

## Grappled Condition (Modified for This Encounter)

While grappled by the grasping dead:
- Speed is 0
- The PC is held by undead limbs clawing from the ground
- The undead deal no additional damage beyond the initial 1d4 unless the PC remains grappled next round

---

## Escaping the Grasp

A grappled PC may choose **one** of the following on their turn:

### 1. Escape Action (RAW)
- Use an **Action**
- Make a **DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics check**
- On success:  
  - Break free
  - May move on a later turn

### 2. Attack the Undead
- Use the **Attack action**
- Any successful hit automatically destroys the grasping undead
- All grasping undead have **HP 1**
- On a hit:
  - The PC is immediately freed

### 3. Help Action
- An adjacent ally may use **Help**
- Automatically frees the grappled PC

---

## Dash Limitation

The terrain constantly pulls at the party.

- **Dash is allowed**, but:
  - Dash grants only **+10 ft of movement**, not full additional movement
- Dashing still requires the Grasping Check

This prevents trivial escape while preserving player agency.

---

## The Banshees (Looming Threat)

- Banshees are **visible and audible at a distance**
- Their wails echo through the canyon
- They do **not** roll initiative
- They close the distance as rounds pass

### DM Control (Intentional)
- If the party is doing well:
  - A banshee may swoop close enough to unleash **one Wail**
  - This is a warning shot, not an execution
- If the party is struggling:
  - The banshees linger just out of reach
  - Pressure remains psychological

**If the party is overtaken fully by the banshees, the encounter becomes lethal.**

---

## Victory Condition

The party survives when:
- They reach the valley floor
- They escape the undead-infested zone
- The banshees fall behind, their wails fading into the distance

---

## Failure State

- Prolonged delay
- Multiple PCs restrained simultaneously
- A banshee closes fully and wails at close range

Failure here likely means death.

---

## DM Notes

- Do not track individual undead
- Treat the ground as hostile
- Emphasize sound, hands, weight, and panic
- This is not a combat to win — it is a disaster to survive
- Adjust banshee proximity dynamically to maintain tension

---

## Tone Reminder
This is the land itself rejecting the living.  
The dead do not want victory.  
They only want to **hold you long enough for the banshees to arrive**.
