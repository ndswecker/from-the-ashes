# Defense of Ellensburg — Two Choices Before the End

As the Hegemony assault intensifies, command collapses into fragments. Orders are no longer issued from a single voice. Messengers arrive breathless, bloodied, shouting over one another.

Lady Ruth cannot be everywhere.

Neither can you.

The party must choose **one initial location** to secure.  
After completing that defense, there will be **time for only one more intervention** before the horns sound at the walls and all remaining defenders are ordered to fall back to the gate.

Where you stand will decide **how Ellensburg survives**—not whether it does.

## Phase I — First Deployment (Choose One)

### 1. The Alder Fields  
*Former athletic grounds, now a killing field*

**Situation**  
The open fields west of the city have become a churning melee. What was once grass and bleachers is now mud, blood, and broken banners. Retreating defenders are being swallowed piecemeal as the Hegemony presses forward in disciplined ranks.

**Why It Matters**  
This is the city’s outer buffer. If it collapses completely, the Hegemony reaches the walls far sooner and in greater strength.

**Nature of the Fight**  
- Open terrain, little cover  
- The party fights as a **hardpoint** inside a massive battle  
- Enemies are numerous but not elite  
- The danger is being surrounded and ground down

**NPC Pressure**  
- **Thalanor** recognizes this as a delaying action and commits without hesitation  
- **Aelthryn** is overwhelmed by the wounded streaming past  
- **Caleb** is closest to breaking here; the scale of the battle terrifies him

**Outcome Impact**  
- **Success:** The city gains precious time; the Hegemony advance slows  
- **Failure or Withdrawal:** The walls face heavier pressure later

### 2. CWU Rugby Practice Pitch  
*The breach toward the university district*

**Situation**  
Barricades have failed near the old rugby pitch. Hegemony forces are pushing inward, probing for routes into the university district where shelters, archives, and medical wards are concentrated.

**Why It Matters**  
If the breach widens, the enemy will spread through the inner city in squads, making coordinated defense impossible.

**Nature of the Fight**  
- Containment and choke-point combat  
- Broken barricades, elevation changes, nearby buildings  
- Enemies attempt to bypass and flank rather than overwhelm

**NPC Pressure**  
- **Thalanor** is in his element, directing movement and holds  
- **Aelthryn** is forced to choose between stabilizing defenders and civilians  
- **Caleb** gains confidence if supported; this is where he can grow

**Outcome Impact**  
- **Success:** The breach is sealed; the inner city remains intact  
- **Failure:** Hegemony squads appear later in unexpected places

### 3. Ellensburg High School  
*Outside the walls — a shelter about to be overrun*

**Situation**  
The high school lies beyond the main defenses. Refugees shelter in classrooms and gyms. Hegemony scouts and raiders have found it. No official defense has been assigned.

**Why It Matters**  
This is not a strategic objective. It is a human one.

**Nature of the Fight**  
- Running battle and evacuation under fire  
- Fires, collapsing corridors, trapped civilians  
- Victory means escape, not holding ground

**NPC Pressure**  
- **Aelthryn** refuses to leave without the wounded  
- **Caleb** fights like his family is inside (because it could be)  
- **Thalanor** knows this costs the city elsewhere—and goes anyway

**Outcome Impact**  
- **Success:** Dozens live who would otherwise die  
- **Failure:** The city survives, but these people do not

---

### 4. Inner Urban Core  
*Old Dairy Queen & First and Last Chance Tavern*

**Situation**  
Enemy forces have broken through into the inner streets. Buildings are burning. Fires threaten to spread unchecked through tightly packed structures.

**Why It Matters**  
If the fires spread, Ellensburg may burn even if the Hegemony is defeated.

**Nature of the Fight**  
- Split focus: combat, rescue, fire suppression  
- Smoke, heat, collapsing structures  
- Enemies deliberately ignite new blazes to sow panic

**NPC Pressure**  
- **Thalanor** prioritizes firebreaks and control zones  
- **Aelthryn** is stretched thin by smoke and casualties  
- **Caleb** is terrified but refuses to abandon trapped civilians

**Outcome Impact**  
- **Success:** Neighborhoods are saved; the city remains livable  
- **Failure:** Ellensburg survives the siege—but burns afterward

---

## Phase II — Second Deployment (Choose One Remaining)

After the first location is secured (or abandoned), a runner arrives.

There is time for **one more action**.

Not two. Not all.

The players may choose **one remaining location** from the above list.

The consequences stack:
- Damage not prevented in Phase I now worsens
- NPC exhaustion and injuries carry forward
- The city’s condition deteriorates visibly

This second fight is harder:
- Fewer allies remain
- Fires are larger
- Enemies are more desperate

Whatever is left undone will be felt at the walls.

---

## Phase III — The Call to the Gate

A horn sounds—long, low, unmistakable.

All remaining defenders are ordered to fall back.

The gates are failing.

Lady Ruth waits above the wall.

No matter what the party chose, no matter what they saved or lost, **this is where everyone ends up**.

Exhausted. Bloodied. Carrying the weight of their choices.

And this is where Ruth decides she is done losing.

---

## DM Guidance — Running the Choice

- Make the **first choice feel like triage**
- Make the **second choice feel cruel**
- Do not punish players mechanically for compassion  
- Let consequences be narrative, visible, remembered

By the time they reach the gate, the players should understand:

Ruth is not acting out of pride.  
She is acting out of *exhaustion*.

And they helped her reach that moment.
