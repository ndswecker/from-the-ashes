# Encounter: **North Yakima Double-Bridge Checkpoint**
*If combat triggers: Deadly (2 Guards + 2 Gargoyles)*

After passing through central Yakima, the party must cross the **twin bridges** spanning the Naches and Yakima rivers.  
Both bridges are fortified with Purity symbols, scripture graffiti, and stone statues of angels that double as **gargoyles**.

The guards here are fewer, but the magical defenses are **stronger**.

---

# 👁️ **NPCs on Duty**
### **Guard Zadok (MM p. 347 – Guard)**
Grim, formal, tired of false papers and rebel trouble.

### **Guard Kenaz (Guard)**
Younger, eager, rule-obsessed, easily flustered.

### **Two Gargoyles: Cherubiel & Gamtiel (MM p. 140)**
Perched on the bridge posts.  
Appear as angelic statues, but animate instantly if commanded by a guard or if deception is detected.

---

# ⚠️ SPECIAL NOTE — If They Were Detected at the First Checkpoint
If the party failed Encounter 1’s checks, triggered the Magic Arches, or were face-sketched:

**All DCs in this encounter increase by +5.**  
The guards have a **description sheet** of suspicious travelers:
- a “small female impersonating a Knight-Commander”  
- a Tiefling female  
- a Goliath male  

This makes the encounter *very* hard to bluff through.

---

# 🧱 **Encounter Structure (Three Phases)**

---

# 1) **PHASE ONE — “Halt at the Bridge”**
As the party approaches, Guard Zadok steps in front of them.

**Zadok:**  
“Halt. Identify yourself and present your writ.  
No one crosses without scrutiny today.”

This requires **ONE High DC check** to play the part:

Choose:  
- **Deception DC 18**  
- **Intimidation DC 18**  
- **Performance DC 18**

*(If flagged from last checkpoint → DC 23)*

**Success:**  
Guards accept their demeanor and proceed to inspect the papers.

**Failure:**  
Guards become tense; gargoyles shift slightly.  
Phase Two DCs increase by **+2**.

---

# 2) **PHASE TWO — Paperwork Verification (Three Checks)**
The guards scrutinize the **Safe-Passage Writ** carefully  
(See: [[Safe-Passage Writ of Mobile Dominion Authority]])  

They question three suspicious points.  
ALL THREE must be passed to avoid escalation.

---

## **Point 1 — The Knight-Commander Issue**
**Kenaz:**  
“You don’t… *look* like a Knight-Commander.  
Why are you traveling without mask or armor?”

- Deception **DC 12**  
- OR Intimidation **DC 12**

*(If flagged previously → DC 17)*

---

## **Point 2 — Lack of Escort**
**Zadok:**  
“Commanders rarely move alone.  
Where is your Purity Escort or Silver Veil retinue?”

- Deception **DC 14**  
- OR Persuasion **DC 14**

*(If flagged previously → DC 19)*

---

## **Point 3 — Uncollared Slaves**
**Kenaz:**  
“Your writ claims unlimited sub-human transport, but neither of these two wears a collar.  
Explain their lack of restraint.”

- Deception **DC 12**  
- OR Intimidation **DC 12**  
- OR plausible RP with doctrine

*(If flagged previously → DC 17)*

---

### ✔ **Pass Condition**
All three checks succeed → proceed through the bridge without magical screening.

### ✖ **Fail Condition**
Fail ANY → Guards order a magical test:

**Zadok:**  
“Bring them to the statues for purity verification.”

This activates the gargoyles and the magic inspection.

---

# 3) **PHASE THREE — The Gargoyle Purity Scan**
Zadok commands the “angelic statues” to awaken.

The gargoyles’ eyes glow blue and they speak in a grinding stonelike whisper:

**Cherubiel:**  
“Submit to *purity examination*.”

This is the equivalent of the Magic Arches from Encounter 1 — except now the **statues themselves do the scanning**.

They smell magic and fiendish energy.  
They **NEVER** fail to detect forbidden items such as the **Bracers of Dominance** (illegal for a non-human).

If they detect the bracers:
- Their eyes turn **crimson**  
- They snarl “CORRUPTION”  
- The guards panic  
- Combat begins immediately

---

# ⚔️ **FAILURE → COMBAT TRIGGERS**
If the scan is failed or the party tries to flee:

### ENEMY FORCES
- **Guard Zadok** (Guard)
- **Guard Kenaz** (Guard)
- **Gargoyles Cherubiel & Gamtiel** (2× Gargoyles)

The gargoyles will attempt to **grapple and restrain the “slaves”** first.  
The guards will shout for reinforcements (not immediately arriving).

---

# ✔ **PASS RESULT**
If the party passes all phases:

- The guards step aside  
- The gargoyles return to statue form  
- No reinforcements are alerted  
- The party crosses the double bridge into north Yakima  
- The resistance safe-house becomes accessible

---

# 🎭 **DM Notes**
- Names reflect Hegemony-approved religious culture.
- This checkpoint is quieter but magically stronger.  
- If the first checkpoint went poorly, this one becomes extremely dangerous.  
- Success means clean entry to the underground railroad shelter.
