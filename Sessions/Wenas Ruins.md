# Session Overview
The party travels through the abandoned **Wenas Enclave** at Wenas Lake, discovers signs of lingering supernatural unrest, and locates the trail leading into the Umtanum highlands. This session foreshadows the banshees and Abimelech while testing mobility and threat assessment.

---

## Scene 1 — Abandoned Enclave Village (Wenas Lake)

**Purpose**
- Establish tone of loss and corruption
- Introduce lesser manifestations of the massacre
- Allow Monk and Rogue to shine early
- Light resource drain

**Location Notes**
- Ruined huts and stone foundations
- Reed-choked lake edge (difficult terrain)
- Low fog at dusk
- Faint uphill trail markers visible after encounter

---

## Encounter 1 — The Weeping Lights of Wenas

**Trigger**
- Investigating ruins
- Lingering near lake
- Searching for mountain trail

### Enemies
- **Will-o’-Wisp ×2 (Weakened)**
  - HP ~18 each
  - AC 19
  - Shock: 2d6 lightning
  - Invisibility: 1/encounter
  - No Consume Life

### Tactics
- Harass from range
- Target Rogue or Monk first
- Avoid Paladin unless pressured
- Retreat toward mountain trail if reduced to low HP

### Spotlight Notes
- Monk mobility + multiple attacks effective
- Rogue easily triggers Sneak Attack
- Paladin useful but smite feels inefficient (intentional)

### Outcome
- Wisps destroyed **or** flee uphill
- Glowing residue marks trail
- PCs gain clarity on direction toward Umtanum ridge

## Discovery — Enclave Restoration Rite (One-Shot)

While searching the ruins of the Wenas Enclave, the party discovers a preserved remnant of enclave magic: a single-use restorative rite left behind by the slain inhabitants.

### Enclave Restoration Rite
**Type:** One-shot magical effect  
**Use:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Uses:** 1 (consumed on use)

When invoked, this rite **casts *Greater Restoration*** on the target creature, with no spellcasting check and no class restriction.

This effect can:
- End one effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum
- Remove one curse or similar soul-affecting condition
- Restore the target from severe spiritual or necrotic harm

Once used, the magic fades completely. No additional uses remain.

**DM Note:**  
This is not a potion or a spell scroll. It is a preserved enclave rite or blessing, intentionally left to counter soul-level damage tied to the massacre site.

## Transition
The party identifies the clear trail leading up into the Umtanum highlands toward the hilltop massacre site. The atmosphere grows colder, quieter, and more oppressive as they ascend.

## Notes for Next Session
- Main battle against **Abimelech** and **Spectre minions**
- Banshee presence hinted but not yet engaged
- Emotional weight should increase steadily
- Environment becomes more exposed and sacred/defiled
