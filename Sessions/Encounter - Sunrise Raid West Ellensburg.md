# Sunrise Raid at the Elven Camp

## Encounter Overview

As dawn approaches, a **Hegemony vanguard** launches a sudden raid against the Elven forward camp near the Yakima River crossing.  
This is not an attempt to retake western Ellensburg — it is a **disruption strike** meant to:

- kill or capture key personnel  
- disrupt command and healing infrastructure  
- deny rest  
- test elven response times  

The players complete a **full long rest** moments before the attack begins.

This encounter is the party’s **first combat inside the Battle of Ellensburg**.

---

## Player Context

**Party**
- Paladin (Level 4)
- Monk (Level 4)
- NPCs:
  - Aelthryn Silverbough (Healer)
  - Commander Thalanor Reedscar (Veteran Officer)
  - Caleb Morrell (Volunteer Defender)

**Friendly Territory**
- The camp and surrounding streets are under elven and Ellensburg control.
- Civilians and wounded are present.
- The front line lies further east, near South Willow Street.

## Opening Scene (Read or Paraphrase)

The first horn does not come from the east.

It comes from *inside* the city.

You are pulled from sleep by shouts — not panicked, but sharp and urgent. Boots strike stone. Someone yells for healers. Another horn answers, closer this time.

Beyond the cottonwoods and low stone walls, you see shapes moving fast through the half-light — disciplined, armored, advancing with purpose.

The sun has not yet cleared the ridge.

The Hegemony has come early.

---

## Fog of War

The wider battle is **abstracted**.

Describe:
- distant fighting in side streets  
- spelllight flaring beyond buildings  
- screams, horns, collapsing structures  

Mechanically, the players fight only what is directly in front of them.

---

## Encounter Structure

This encounter unfolds in **three phases**.  
Do not announce phases to players — let them feel the escalation.

---

## Phase I — Wake-Up Strike

### Enemy Forces
- **1 Cult Fanatic** (leader)
- **2 Guards**
- **1 Cultist**

### Entry
- The Cult Fanatic enters shouting scripture.
- Guards move immediately toward NPCs.
- The Cultist charges recklessly.

### Enemy Objectives
- Kill or disable the healer
- Cause panic
- Draw defenders away from the eastern front

### Tactical Notes
- Guards attempt to pin NPCs
- Fanatic uses control or support spells early
- Enemies do not retreat in this phase

---

## Phase II — Escalation Push (2–3 rounds later)

### Trigger
Phase II begins when:
- the Cult Fanatic is killed **or**
- an NPC is seriously threatened **or**
- 3 rounds pass

### Enemy Forces
- **1 Veteran**
- **2 Guards**

### Entry
- Veteran arrives from a side street with disciplined timing.
- Guards form a loose screen.

### Enemy Objectives
- Break the defenders’ cohesion
- Kill an officer if possible
- Withdraw if command resistance stiffens

### Tactical Notes
- Veteran fights intelligently
- Focuses on whoever is holding the line
- Will disengage if badly wounded or outnumbered

---

## Optional Phase III — Officer Probe (Use Only If Needed)

### Trigger (Choose One)
- Players are dominating
- No NPC has been seriously threatened
- You want a sharp, dramatic capstone

### Enemy Forces
- **1 Knight**
- **1 Cultist**

### Entry
- Knight advances openly, confident, testing defenders
- Cultist follows, shouting doctrine

### Enemy Objectives
- Identify champions
- Force a response
- Withdraw once challenged

### Tactical Notes
- Knight seeks a duel
- Retreats once bloodied or isolated
- This is a **probe**, not a death march

---

## NPC Danger Pressure

During the encounter:
- NPCs should be **visibly threatened**
- Enemies should **attempt to reach them**
- Never dogpile — pressure, don’t execute

Recommended escalation:
- Aelthryn pinned by Guards
- Thalanor holding a chokepoint too long
- Caleb overextending to protect someone else

NPC survival should require **player attention**.

---

## Resolution

The raid ends when:
- enemy leadership is destroyed
- attackers withdraw
- elven reinforcements arrive from nearby streets

There is **no victory celebration**.

Smoke rises from deeper in the city.  
Messengers are already shouting new orders.  
The real battle is moving east.

---

## Consequences

Track the following for later encounters:
- Which NPCs survived
- Which enemy leaders escaped
- How quickly the raid was contained

These will affect:
- unit availability
- morale
- later city encounters
- how Ellensburg remembers the party

---

## DM Guidance

- Keep the encounter tight: 4–6 total enemies at once
- End fights early if objectives are met
- Let enemies retreat — survival is information

This fight is not about winning.

It is about **proving the war has found them**.
