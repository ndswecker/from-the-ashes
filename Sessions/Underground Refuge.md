# Encounter: **Umtanum’s Secrets**
*A Casablanca-inspired resistance refuge hidden inside a human-only bar.*

“Umtanum’s Secrets” is a smoky, melancholy bar serving as both a legitimate gathering place for humans and a deeply concealed refuge for smuggled non-humans.  
Piano music drifts through the haze. Regret and hope mingle here like old ghosts.

The bar is owned by **Richard Paine**, Yellen’s former lover — the man she left behind when she ran north to rescue Lady Ruth Ginsengburg.

# 🎹 **Area Description – The Bar Front**
- Warm lanternlight through haze  
- Piano in the corner played by **Samson Elihu (“Sam”)**, blind musician  
- Humans drinking quietly, afraid of the world outside  
- Off-duty laborers, gamblers, and lonely souls  
- A strict “NO NON-HUMANS” sign over the counter  
- The faint sound of footsteps echoing from below (the basement refuge)

Richard Paine runs the bar with careful neutrality — or so he claims.

# ❤️ **Richard Paine – The ‘Rick’ Character**
Former resistance courier. Sharp jaw, sleeves rolled up, world-weary charm.

When Yellen enters, he freezes with a glass in hand.

**Richard Paine:**  
“Well… you finally came walking back into my bar.”

**Yellen – Player Dialogue Options:**  
- “I didn’t expect to return.”  
- “I’m here because I had to be.”  
- “This isn’t the time, Richard.”  
- “I’m sorry. I truly am.”

**Richard Paine:**  
“You left me in the dark without a word.  
Ran off with that noblewoman.  
Was she worth it?”

**Yellen Options:**  
- “Every mile. Every wound.”  
- “Yes.”  
- “It was duty, not love.”  
- “I don’t know anymore.”

Richard cracks, just a little.

**Richard Paine:**  
“Drink’s on the house…  
but don’t mistake it for forgiveness.”

Despite the bitterness, he helps them.  
He always helps them.

# ⛓️ **Basement Refuge – Non-Human Sanctuary**
A hidden door behind a wine rack leads to a cramped underground safehouse:

- Non-human refugees (Tieflings, Goliaths, Elves, Half-Orcs)  
- Medical supplies, ration crates  
- Forged Purity Papers in progress  
- Soft hum of fear mixed with flickers of hope  
- The password:  
  - *“Does the Lily still bloom?”*  
  - Response: *“Only in shadow.”*

This is where the players may rest safely.

# 🥃 **Key Patrons**
### **Miriam Kess – The Betrayer**
- Nervous, middle-aged woman  
- Drinks to numb her trauma  
- Stares too hard at the party  
- Slips out early in the morning to report them

### **Elias Thorn**
- Scarred veteran  
- Loyal to the resistance  
- Would help hide players if needed

### **Naomi Deller**
- Seamstress  
- Helps stitch up refugees  
- Quiet but kind

### **“Lucky” Josiah Varr**
- Gambler  
- Talks too loud, knows too much  
- Believes in Yellen’s cause

---

# 🌙 **The Long Rest**
The players sleep in the basement among refugees.

- A brief moment of warmth  
- Richard Paine brings blankets  
- Sam’s piano music drifts through the floorboards like a lullaby  
- Yellen feels the weight of the past pressing in  
- Everyone goes to sleep knowing dawn may bring danger

---

# 🌅 **The Morning Betrayal**
At dawn, Richard wakes them with a whisper:

**Richard Paine:**  
“Get up. Someone talked.”

Miriam Kess has already fled the bar at sunrise, slipping information to the nearest Purity patrol:

> “Non-humans are hiding in Umtanum’s Secrets.”

---

# 🔥 **The Burning Palm Raid**
The **Order of the Burning Palm** arrives — zealous, fire-purifying knights who root out impurity with flame.

### **Forces Arriving**
- **Knight-Commander Malachi Pyreson** *(Knight, MM p. 347; reskinned with fire motifs)*  
- **1 Acolyte of the Burning Palm** *(Acolyte MM p. 342; fire spells)*  
- **2 Purity Soldiers** *(Guards MM p. 347; scorched red tabards)*  
- **1 Fire Snake** *(MM p. 265)*  

They storm the front of the bar.

### **Malachi Pyreson:**
**“This establishment harbors impurity.  
Bring everyone out.  
We begin with the basement.”**

They sweep the front room first — giving the players a few precious seconds.

---

# 🕵️ **Option A — The Players Attempt to Hide**
Stealth checks for the whole party.

- Failure → they are discovered  
- Success → Malachi interrogates the bar, then leaves…  
  *unless something goes wrong below*

Sam changes his piano tune to a tense rhythm (danger signal).

---

# 🗣️ **Option B — The Players Step Forward**
They reveal themselves and try to bluff with:

### **Safe-Passage Papers**
(Expiring in less than two days.)

**Malachi:**  
“These writs nearly lapsed.  
Why are you still in Yakima?  
And why does a Knight-Commander travel without escort?”

### **Social Challenge (3 Checks)**
- Deception **DC 16–18**  
- Intimidation **DC 16–18**  
- Persuasion **DC 16–18**  
- If they were flagged or sketched earlier → all DCs +4

Success:  
Malachi relents.

**Malachi:**  
“Renew your writ.  
This is your last warning.”

Failure:  
He gives the order:

**“Burn them out.”**

---

# ⚔️ **COMBAT TRIGGER (if social fails or hiding fails)**
- Knight-Commander Malachi Pyreson (Knight stats)  
- Acolyte of the Burning Palm (fire spells)  
- 2 Purity Soldiers (Guards)  
- **1 Fire Snake**, slithering with glowing embers

Inside the tight bar, this becomes desperate and chaotic.

Richard Paine may help distract enemies or show the players an escape hatch into a sewer tunnel.

Sam stops playing the piano mid-chord the moment weapons are drawn.

---

# 🛣️ **PASS CONDITION**
- The party successfully hides OR  
- They successfully convince Malachi using their Safe-Passage Writ  

**Result:**  
- The Burning Palm leaves  
- Richard Paine warns them:  
  **“Your papers won’t save you for long. Get out of Yakima.”**

The path north toward Wenas opens.

---

# 🎭 **DM Notes**
- Lean heavily into Casablanca tone: bittersweet romance, betrayal, regret, hope.  
- Richard loves Yellen but won’t interfere irrationally.  
- The betrayal should feel tragic, not malicious.  
- The fire snake creates visual holy terror — “purifying flame” symbolism.  
- If players succeed socially, it should feel *earned* and cinematic.  
- If they fail, the fight is brutal in close quarters — use overturned tables, broken bottles, fire hazards.
