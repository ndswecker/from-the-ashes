## Read-Aloud Description

The cinderblock warehouse breathes with heat and chemical sweetness. Opium resin boils in iron vats, and enslaved non-humans move through the haze in perfect, unnatural rhythm — each one bound by a glowing slave collar. A crumpled poster hangs above them: *LABOR IS WORSHIP.*

At the center of the floor, a Preservationist priest chants in a rasping monotone, fingers twitching in ritual code:  
`for soul in workers: maintain_uptime(soul)`  
With each whispered loop, the lights pulse and the machinery shudders back to life.

Near a rusted catwalk stands Lady Ruth Ginsengburg, an elf of Elvensworth, her eyes glassy under the collar’s command. And watching her — still as a blade in a sheath — is the Knight-Captain of the Silver Veil.

He looks up the moment you enter.
