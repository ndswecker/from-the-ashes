# Encounter Overview
This encounter takes place atop a wind-scoured ridge under an open night sky.  
At the center lies a **ring of unnatural red sagebrush**, marking the site of Abimelech’s genocide and binding his spirit to the land.  
A **weathered banner staff bearing the sigil of Jehovah-as-Bane** pins the Wraith in place and fuels his power.

This is an **objective-based boss fight**. Killing Abimelech outright is possible but dangerous; removing the banner is the intended solution.

---

## Battlefield

- **Open ridge top**, no walls or cover
- **Red Sage Ring (Desecrated Ground)**  
  - Roughly circular, clearly visible
  - Abimelech is bound to this area
- **Open sky, constant wind**
- No artificial light beyond moonlight and spectral glow

---

## Boss — Abimelech (Wraith)

**Stat Block:** Standard *Wraith* (Monster Manual)  
**Movement:** Cannot leave the red sage circle  
**Behavior:** Tyrannical, commanding, hateful; does not flee

### Modified Life Drain Rule
- **Life Drain reduces maximum HP only while the Banner Staff remains inside the red sage circle**
- If the banner is removed from the circle:
  - Life Drain still deals necrotic damage
  - **No max-HP reduction occurs**

Abimelech has **no additional fear, domination, or soul-control abilities** beyond the standard Wraith stat block.

---

## Minions — Specters

- **Specter ×2 (maximum active at any time)**
- HP reduced to **15–18 each**
- Role: **battlefield control and harassment**
- Tactics:
  - Attempt to block, harry, or isolate PCs
  - Prioritize keeping PCs away from the banner
  - Especially pressure the Monk and Rogue

**Optional Reinforcement (Once Per Fight):**
- One additional Specter may rise as a reaction to:
  - The banner being disturbed, **or**
  - The first Specter being destroyed  
After this, no further Specters can be summoned.

---

## The Banner Staff (Primary Objective)

The banner staff is embedded at the center of the red sage ring.

### Removing the Banner
- **Action required**
- Strength (Athletics) check **or** strong narrative justification
- Removing the banner provokes immediate retaliation if Abimelech is able

### Effects When the Banner Leaves the Circle
- Abimelech has **disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks**
- Life Drain no longer reduces maximum HP
- No new Specters may be summoned
- The fight enters its endgame phase

This moment should feel like a clear **turning point**.

---

## Player Resources (Expected)

- **Greater Potion of Healing** (HP recovery only)
- **One-Shot Greater Restoration Relic** (from Wenas Enclave ruins)
  - Can reverse max-HP reduction if Life Drain occurred earlier

---

## Victory Conditions

The encounter ends when:
- Abimelech is destroyed, **or**
- The banner is removed and Abimelech collapses within 1–2 rounds

---

## DM Notes

- This fight is intentionally lethal **before** the banner is removed
- Emphasize visual and narrative feedback when:
  - Life Drain reduces max HP
  - The banner is touched or pulled free
- Specters are pressure tools, not damage engines
- Reward bold movement and objective play over brute force

---

## Tone Reminder
This is not just a fight.  
This is the party **defying a monument to tyranny** and tearing a symbol of domination out of the earth.
