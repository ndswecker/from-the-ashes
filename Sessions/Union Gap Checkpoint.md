# Encounter: **Union Gap Checkpoint**
*If combat triggers: Deadly (Bandit Captain + 3 Scouts + 2 Blink Dogs)*

The party approaches the fortified Union Gap checkpoint.  
News of the **Legacy Fruit Opium Factory incident** has placed all guards on high alert.

The guard force here is commanded by a harsh Purity Captain with a zealot's posture.  
They immediately question the legitimacy of the party’s Safe-Passage Papers.

---

# 👁️ **NPCs on Duty**
### **Purity Captain Malach (Bandit Captain, MM p. 344)**
Leader of the checkpoint. Suspicious, rigid, used to catching liars.

### **Scout Haggai (Scout, MM p. 349)**
Stern and quiet. Watches the slaves closely.

### **Scout Abner (Scout)**
Talkative, mildly cruel, eager to impress Malach.

### **Scout Zerah (Scout)**
Paranoid; convinced rebels are everywhere.

### **Blink Dogs: Boaz & Joram (MM p. 318)**
Arcane-sniffers trained to detect magical contraband and shapeshifters.

# 🧱 **Encounter Structure**
This encounter has **three phases**:

---

# 1) **PHASE ONE — “Play the Part”**
The party is stopped immediately.

**Malach:**  
“Halt! Identify your authority and your purpose!”

The party must make **ONE High-DC check** to look and act the part of a Hegemony travel unit.

Choose:  
- **Deception DC 20**  
- **Intimidation DC 20**  
- **Performance DC 20**

**On Success:**  
The guards treat them as potential legitimate travelers and move to verify paperwork.

**On Failure:**  
Malach grows hostile.  
All Phase Two DCs increase by **+2**.

---

# 2) **PHASE TWO — Paperwork Scrutiny (Three Checks)**
The Safe-Passage Writ is examined carefully.

The guards challenge the legitimacy of three suspicious details.  
ALL THREE checks must be passed to avoid escalation.

---

## **Point 1: No Name on the Writ**
**Zerah:**  
“Knight-Commander? Without a name? Explain yourself.”

- Deception **DC 12**  
- OR Intimidation **DC 12**  
- OR recite *Doctrine Article 14: Operational Privacy* for auto-success via RP

---

## **Point 2: Nearly Expired Papers**
**Haggai:**  
“These expire in two days. Why risk moving north right before renewal?”

- Deception **DC 12**  
- OR Persuasion **DC 12**

---

## **Point 3: No Escort for a Commander**
**Malach:**  
“Unlimited slaves, no escort?  
A Knight-Commander travels *alone*? Explain.”

- Deception **DC 14**  
- OR Intimidation **DC 14**

---

### ✔ **Pass Condition**
All three checks succeed → Proceed to Yakima without further inspection.

### ✖ **Fail Condition**
Fail ANY → Immediate escalation:

**Malach:**  
“Enough. Take them through the Arches.”

Move to Phase Three.

---

# 3) **PHASE THREE — Magic Detection Arches**
Two Hegemony metal-and-rune arches scan travelers for magic presence.

**If the Tiefling’s Bracers of Dominance are detected**  
→ The arches glow **bright red**, the blink dogs begin teleporting around the party, and the scouts draw weapons.  
(Bracers item reference: [[Bracers of Dominance]] :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0})

**Additionally:**  
Scouts use a **Face-Sketching Tablet** to magically record each traveler’s likeness for future checkpoints.

This is extremely bad.

---

# ⚔️ **FAILURE → COMBAT TRIGGERS**
If the party is caught with concealed magic, fails the Arches, or attempts to flee:

### ENEMY FORCES
- **Purity Captain Malach** (Bandit Captain)
- **3 Hegemony Scouts** (Haggai, Abner, Zerah)
- **2 Blink Dogs** (Boaz, Joram)

**This is a deadly battle.**  
The intended resolution is **social**, not combat.

---

# ✔ **PASS RESULT**
If the party succeeds at every stage:

- No magic detection  
- No face-sketching  
- No alerts are issued  
- They proceed into Yakima with clean cover  
- Guards will remain wary but respectful of their “Knight-Commander” writ

---

# 🎭 **DM Notes**

- The guards are suspicious primarily because **Yellen does not resemble** a Knight-Commander.  
- They are also under tension due to recent attacks and Hegemony doctrine (see: [[Jehovah’s Hegemony of Greater Idaho]] :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}).  
- This is meant to be an **intense social gauntlet**, not a fight.  
- The blink dogs should pace, sniff, and teleport unpredictably to build pressure.  
- Use Malach’s harsh tone to enforce fear; use Zerah’s paranoia to justify questioning; use Abner’s cruelty to push for humiliation of the “slaves.”
