## 🌅 **Introduction**

The world has ended.  
The world has changed.  
A new dawn rises on humanity, and we humans find ourselves no longer the lords of this world.

We now stand in the shadows of our dead and buried patriarchs…  
in the shadows of new races…  
in the shadows of new gods.

Once we sought to make our land great.  
Those days are behind us.  
Now, humanity seeks only to **survive**.

Everything humankind built has rusted and fallen into disuse.  
The technologies we relied on to dominate our world no longer obey us:

- Guns stopped firing.  
- Factories ceased their endless churning.  
- Phones went dark.  
- Computers refused to answer our commands.

An unseen force has seeped into our world — perhaps not entirely new, but once hidden, whispered about, feared.

Now it stands unveiled:

# ✨ **Magic**  

The Age of Magic has dawned.  
Monsters, dragons, demons, and gods walk our shattered roads.

Could Mystra herself be synonymous with Mother Nature?  
Is magic nothing more — or less — than the wild heartbeat of the world, awakened and unbound?

These questions remain unanswered…  
but all who survive must live under this new truth:

**Magic rules the land now.**
