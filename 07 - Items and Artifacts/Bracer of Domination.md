# Bracers of Dominance

**Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement, corruptive)**

These interlocking silver bracers are engraved with scripture praising Jehovah’s (Bane’s) dominion.  
They hum with psychic pressure and radiate a subtle authoritarian aura.  
Forged for the knightly orders of the Hegemony, the bracers allow their wearer to command creatures bound by a **Slave Collar of Subjugation**.

Merely touching the bracers exposes the mind to whispers of authority, hierarchy, and control.

## ✨ *Command the Slave*

As a **bonus action**, you may attempt to command a creature wearing any **Slave Collar of Subjugation** within 60 feet.

Make a **Charisma check with a +10 bonus**.

- **DC 22** → The creature must use its next turn to take *any action* of your choice*, and you choose its movement.  
- **Failure** → The creature resists; you cannot target it again until your next turn.

\*Actions cannot cause direct self-harm

## ☠️ Corruption of Dominion

Every dawn, the wearer makes a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw**.

### **On a Success**
- No corruption is gained.  
- The bracers whisper faintly but exert no further control.

### **On a Failure**
Roll the **Corruption Die (1d4)**:

1. **Dominance Hunger**  
   Intrusive thoughts urge you to control others.  
   Advantage on Persuasion checks against free creatures.

2. **Rigid Obedience**  
   You exhibit Silver Veil authoritarian tendencies.  
   In your next combat, you must spend one action issuing a command (verbal, narrative, or tactical).

3. **Banite Influence**  
   You distrust challenges to your authority.  
   Disadvantage on Insight checks until your next long rest.

4. **Loss of Self**  
   Gain 1 **Corruption Point**.  
   At **3 Corruption Points**, you become **Cursed by Dominion**.

### ⚠ Forced Attunement
If you **fail this corruption check while not attuned**, you immediately become *attuned* to the bracers.  
This cannot be resisted unless you are unconscious.

## 🔒 Curse of Dominion (At 3 Corruption Points)

When you reach **3 Corruption Points**, Bane brands your spirit with an invisible mark of dominance.

You become **Cursed**, and the following effects apply:

- The bracers **fuse to your skin** and cannot be removed or unattuned by any voluntary means.  
- You cannot willingly assist in their removal.  
- You cannot willingly reduce yourself to 0 HP.  
- You instinctively resist attempts to strip you of authority or status.  
- The bracers exert a constant mental pressure encouraging domination and control.

### **Only Method of Removal**

The curse is broken **only if another creature reduces you to 0 HP**.

- The damage must come from an **external source** (attack, spell, trap, environmental hazard).  
- You cannot willingly cooperate in this process.  
- When you hit 0 HP, the bracers **fall away**, inert.  
- They must be removed **before you are healed** or they will immediately reattach.

Once removed, the character is no longer cursed and their corruption points reset to **0**.

The bracers remain dangerous and corruptive to anyone who touches them thereafter.

## 🛡 Magical Interference

- **Remove Curse**  
  Suppresses corruption progression for 24 hours but cannot remove the bracers once cursed.

- **Greater Restoration**  
  Removes **1 Corruption Point** (but cannot un-fuse cursed bracers).

- **Wish / Divine Intervention**  
  DM discretion, but even these powers may fail if the wearer is unwilling.
