# Slave Collar of Subjugation

**Wondrous Item, common (psychologically damaging, pairs with Bracers of Dominance)**

A thick steel band etched with scripture proclaiming human supremacy and divine dominion.  
When clasped around a creature’s neck, the collar seals instantly with a magnetic-lock enchantment created by the Priests of Jehovah (Bane).  
It is designed not for elegance, but for cruelty. The interior edge digs into the skin. The scripture rubs like sandpaper. It is unmistakably an instrument of subjugation.

Collars are mass-produced in the Hegemony heartland and issued freely to Overseers and Silver Veil knights.  
**Keys, however, are rare**, for slaves are not meant to be freed.

## ✨ Function — Receiver of Dominion

While wearing this collar, the creature becomes a valid target for the **Command the Slave** ability from the *Bracers of Dominance*.

- The bracer-wearer may attempt to force the collared creature to take actions on their next turn.  
- The collar itself grants no abilities and no protections.  
- Its sole purpose is to make domination simple, universal, and brutal.

## Possesing but not Subjugated — When Holding an Unused Collar

Before a long rest, while holdig this collar in a player's possession, the owner must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw**.

### On Success
- The player may freely chose what do with the corrupt artifact.

### On a Failure
- The player is compelled to keep the collar and takes one **Corruption Point**.

Upon 3 corruption points the owner of the collar is compelled to place the collar on the nearest non-human who does not already have the collar.

## ☠️ Daily Psychological Harm

Every dawn, the wearer rolls a **d4** and suffers the associated intrusive thoughts and emotional damage for the next 24 hours.

These effects are *not magical* — they represent the conditioning, humiliation, and internalized oppression caused by the collar’s weight, design, and implied social meaning.

**1 — Worthlessness**  
“You deserve this. This is your place.”  
→ *Disadvantage on Persuasion checks.*

**2 — Fear of Rebellion**  
“If you resist, you will be punished.”  
→ *Disadvantage on Intimidation checks.*

**3 — Identity Collapse**  
“You are not a person. You are property.”  
→ *Disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against fear.*

**4 — Helplessness Spiral**  
“It is pointless to fight. The world belongs to them.”  
→ *Disadvantage on Initiative rolls.*

These effects end immediately when the collar is removed.

## 🔓 Removal — Hegemony Forged Key

The collar can only be removed by a **Hegemony Forged Key**, created exclusively in Idaho by the Priesthood and issued sparingly to Silver Veil officers.

- The key has **two charges**.  
- Each use expends one charge and opens one collar.  
- The collar **does not resist** being opened; the magic simply unlatches.  
- Without a key, removal requires extremely high-level magic (DM discretion).

The Hegemony rarely bothers to remove collars; keys exist primarily for officer convenience, not mercy.

## 🧩 Additional Notes

- The collar is **not** inherently cursed. Its harm is psychological, not supernatural.  
- It is considered **heresy and a major crime** to place a collar on a full-status Hegemony human.  
- When the wearer dies, the collar unlocks automatically.  
- The collar is intentionally low-cost, widely distributed, and meant to break spirits, not bodies.
