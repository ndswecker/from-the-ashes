# Digital-Induced Perceptual Deterioration Disorder  
### *(Proposed DSM Entry)*

## Diagnostic Criteria

### **A. Dissociative Core Symptoms**  
A persistent or recurrent disturbance in perception or experience of the self or surroundings, as evidenced by one or more of the following:

1. **Depersonalization:**  
   Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside observer to one’s thoughts, feelings, body, or actions (e.g., “my hands aren’t mine,” “I feel hollow,” “I’m watching myself from outside”).

2. **Derealization:**  
   Experiences of unreality or detachment from surroundings (e.g., objects appear fogged, muted, distant, dreamlike, desaturated, or “behind glass”).

3. **Emotional Desaturation:**  
   Noticeable reduction in emotional responsiveness, including blunted affect, muted emotional reactions, or inability to feel connection to others.

### **B. Digital Exposure Requirement**  
Symptoms in Criterion A develop **during or after prolonged digital media engagement**, defined as:

- Extensive daily screen use (typically 8–12+ hours/day)  
- Repetitive consumption of algorithmic content streams  
- Difficulty disengaging from digital devices  
- Distress or anxiety when digital access is restricted  

### **C. Progressive Sensory or Cognitive Impairment**  
One or more of the following must be present:

1. **Sensory Gating Reduction:**  
   Sounds, colors, and sensory inputs appear muted, dulled, or distant.

2. **Altered Proprioception:**  
   Distortions in bodily awareness, delayed self-recognition, or disconnection from physical movement.

3. **Cognitive Drift:**  
   Memory gaps, time-loss episodes, autopilot behavior, or lapses in self-initiated actions.

### **D. Functional Impairment**  
The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or personal functioning, such as:

- Loss of interest in relationships  
- Inability to maintain focus at work  
- Withdrawal from physical-world activities  
- Reduced capability for self-care  

### **E. Not Better Explained By:**  
The symptoms are not attributable to:

- Substance use  
- Neurological conditions  
- Sleep deprivation  
- Major depressive or psychotic disorders  
- Medical conditions that better account for the presentation  

*Note:* Normal neurological imaging and cognitive testing are often observed despite severe subjective symptoms.

## Clinical Features

### **Course and Progression**
DIPDD typically progresses through distinct stages:

- **Early Dissociative Drift:** Fog, detachment, mild depersonalization  
- **Perceptual Decoupling:** Body/mind disconnect, sensory dulling  
- **Identity Dilution:** Emotional collapse, visual distortions  
- **Gossamer State:** Flat affect, diminished responsiveness  
- **Collapse:** Catatonic-like preservation of basic bodily function

The progression may occur over **weeks to months**, often accelerating despite removal from digital platforms.

### **Associated Features**
- Panic or agitation when separated from digital devices  
- Flattened or monotone speech  
- Reduced blink rate and visual focus  
- Episodes of apparent “trance-like” scrolling  
- Social withdrawal and existential distress  

### **Prevalence**
Emerging reports suggest increased incidence in populations with high digital engagement, particularly among young adults and individuals with sedentary screen-based occupations.

### **Differential Diagnosis**
DIPDD may resemble:

- Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder  
- Dissociative Disorders  
- Digital Media Addiction  
- Sensory Processing Disorders  
- Catatonia (late-stage presentation)  
- Severe Major Depressive Disorder  
- Autism Spectrum sensory overload (overlap possible)  

However, DIPDD is distinguished by:
- Predictable stage progression  
- Onset directly tied to digital use  
- Normal neurological imaging  
- Persistent dissociation even after detoxification

## Proposed Diagnostic Specifiers

- **With Severe Sensory Desaturation**  
- **With Identity Drift Episodes**  
- **With Autopilot Behavior**  
- **With Device-Separation Panic**  
- **Late-Stage Gossamer Presentation**

## Treatment Considerations

### **Interventions Attempted**
- Digital abstinence  
- Grounding and mindfulness exercises  
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  
- Sensory re-engagement therapy  
- Pharmacotherapy (SSRIs, anxiolytics)  
- Structured re-socialization environments  

### **Clinical Outcomes**
Most patients show:
- Temporary stabilization  
- Little long-term improvement  
- Continued progression in severe cases  

No intervention reliably reverses the disorder’s advanced stages.

## Notes for Clinicians
DIPDD presents a unique challenge due to:
- Its consistent association with heavy digital exposure  
- Its progression despite intervention  
- Its normal imaging results  
- The similarity across geographically distant cases  

Clinicians are encouraged to document symptom progression thoroughly and report cases to emerging digital-mental-health research centers.
