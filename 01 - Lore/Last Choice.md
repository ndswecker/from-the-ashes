# The Last Choice of Lady Ruth Ginsengburg

## Act I — The Breaking of the World

The gates of Ellensburg shudder.

Not once—but again and again—each impact echoing like a drum counting down the last moments of a dying world.

Smoke rolls over the walls in choking waves. Horns sound beyond the gate: deep, disciplined, endless. The Hegemony does not chant. It does not rage. It advances.

Elven archers loose until their fingers bleed. The wounded are dragged through mud darkened by ash and blood. The air smells of pitch, iron, and fear.

Lady Ruth Ginsengburg stands on the wall, unmoving.

Her armor is old—patched, reforged, repaired across a century and a half. Ash clings to her face. Her hair has come loose from its bindings. She watches the field with the stillness of someone who has already buried everyone she loves.

Spokane’s banners are visible now. Reinforcements. Fresh troops. Endless ranks.

This battle is lost.

Ruth knows it.

She has *always* known it.

## Act II — The Words She Never Wanted to Say

Ruth turns to the players.

Her voice is hoarse—not from shouting, but from holding everything in for too long.

> “I need you to listen to me,” she says.  
> “Not as soldiers. Not as heroes. As witnesses.”

If the players protest, she raises a hand—not in command, but in apology.

> “I have had plans my entire life.”

She gestures toward the battlefield.

> “I planned Ginsengburg. I planned the Umtanum Enclave. I planned Elvensworth. I planned resistance cells and evacuation routes and hidden stores of grain and steel.”

Her hand trembles.

> “And every plan ended in graves.”

She looks at them fully now.

> “I am so tired of being brave.”

The gate cracks. Stone splinters.

She exhales.

> “History pretends we have choices. This is one of those moments.”  
> “But do not mistake me.”

Her jaw tightens.

> “I am not choosing power.”  
> “I am choosing *rest*.”

## Act III — When Time Refuses to Move

The next blow never lands.

Time freezes.

Ash hangs in the air like suspended snow. Arrows halt mid-flight. Fire pauses in the act of devouring.

Sound dies.

Then comes heat.

The ground fractures, revealing not earth but black stone etched with glowing infernal script. The sky peels open into a crimson firmament threaded with iron chains and distant screaming stars.

Ellensburg and the Nine Hells overlap.

Footsteps echo—measured, unhurried, inevitable.

A tall figure approaches, clad in red and gold. His horns curve like a patient crown. His eyes are not cruel.

They are *interested*.

> “Ruth Ginsengburg,” he says softly.  
> “We have spoken so many times. I feared you had grown tired of me.”

She does not bow.

> “Asmodeus,” she replies.  
> “You always come when the world is ending.”

A faint smile.

> “People are most honest then.”

## Act IV — The Clause That Changes Everything

An obsidian table rises from the ground. Upon it rests a contract—already written. A quill lies beside it, its tip gleaming wetly.

Asmodeus gestures politely.

> “Victory today. Safety for your people. One hundred years without Hegemonic conquest.”

He looks to the frozen city.

> “A generous span, by mortal reckoning.”

> “And my soul,” Ruth says flatly.

> “Yes.”

She studies the parchment.

Then she shakes her head.

> “No.”

The air tightens.

She steps closer to the table.

> “I will not be owned.”  
> “I will not be collared.”  
> “I will not serve as a slave—*not again*.”

Asmodeus’s expression sharpens—not anger, but focus.

> “You propose an amendment.”

> “I do,” Ruth says.  
> “I will serve you for one hundred years *by choice*.”  
> “I will act as your general willingly, with my mind intact and my will my own.”

Her voice hardens.

> “If my free will is stripped—if I am compelled, dominated, or enslaved—then the contract is void.”  
> “You lose me. You lose everything.”

Silence stretches.

Then Asmodeus laughs quietly.

> “You are remarkable,” he says.  
> “Even now, you negotiate like a judge.”

She meets his gaze without fear.

> “I have buried too many people to sign away my self.”

At last, Asmodeus inclines his head.

> “Agreed,” he says.  
> “Willing service. Free will preserved.”  
> “One hundred years.”

> “And my people?” Ruth asks.

> “Protected,” he replies.  
> “Today—and for a century.”

She turns to the players.

Tears cut clean lines through the ash on her face.

> “I will not be a slave again,” she says.  
> “If only the powerful have choices—then this one is *mine*.”

She takes the quill.

Draws a blade across her palm.

Blood strikes parchment.

She signs.

## Act V — The Price Is Paid

The contract vanishes.

Asmodeus raises one hand.

Far to the west, in the shadow of Mount Tahoma the Ancient Red Dragon stirs and spreads her wings. The Lord of the Nine Hells calls to her, mother of the hungry, mother of the damned.

> “The debt is acknowledged,” Asmodeus says.

Time resumes.

The dragon descends from the high country and flies low over the city gates. Its bat-like wings brush the players hair and the smell of wrath fills the air. Fire pours from her mouth and bathes the forces of the Hegemony.

Fire consumes the battlefield. Hegemonic lines collapse in moments. Steel melts. Banners burn. General Hezekiah does not even have time to scream.

Victory falls from the sky.

And as the city cries out in disbelief—  
as survivors weep and kneel and embrace—  
chains coil around Ruth.

Not binding chains.

Guiding ones.

She does not resist.

As she is pulled towards Asmodeus, she looks back at the players.

> “Find the contract,” she says quietly.

She smiles—small, real, unbearably tired.

> “And remind Hell…”  
> “that free souls can be stolen back.”

She is gone.

Ellensburg stands.

The dragon turns back with dozens of dead humans in her claws to feed her ravenous young in the mountain. Limbs fall from the sky and she flies back to her den.

Victory is won.

And the cost echoes long after the fire fades.

## Long-Term Truth (DM Knowledge)

- The contract **exists** as a physical infernal artifact.
- Ruth serves Asmodeus **willingly**, not as a thrall.
- Any violation of her free will **nullifies the pact**.
- Ruth will become one of Hell’s greatest generals—but she remains herself.
- Someday, the players may steal the contract and bring her home.

Not today.

But someday.
