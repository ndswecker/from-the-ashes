# The Chronicle of David, Chapter 3

1. And it came to pass in the first century after the Great Burning,  
   that Jehovah looked upon the Wenas Valley and was displeased.

2. For in the Umtanum Hills there dwelt a people not of Man,  
   who bowed themselves to many gods,  
   defiling the land Jehovah had given unto the sons of Man.

3. And Jehovah spake unto Abimelech, General of Yakima:  
   *“Go up. Purge the high places.  
   Make no covenant with the idolater,  
   that the land be clean before Me.”*

4. But Abimelech’s heart was divided,  
   and though he gathered the Silver Veil and marched with banner and steel,  
   compassion strove against obedience.

5. I, David, was captain under his hand,  
   and my zeal was whole before Jehovah.

6. When we came unto the Enclave, the false races brought forth bread and herbs,  
   feigning peace with flattering lips;  
   and Abimelech’s countenance softened.

7. And I said unto him,  
   “My lord, remember the command.  
   These are as the Canaanites of old—worshipers of many gods.  
   One God, One Land, One Human-kind.”

8. But Abimelech rebuked me, saying,  
   “The sword is not always wisdom, David.  
   I will show mercy, that Jehovah may be magnified.”

9. ★ Then Ruth of Ginsengburg came forth, veiled in white and adorned with flowers of the grove,  
   her beauty as snares and her words as smooth oil.

10. ★ And she said,  
    “Great lord, we will honor thy God among our gods.  
    Only spare us, and we shall dwell beneath thy shadow.”

11. ★ And Abimelech stretched forth his hand unto her,  
    for her words pleased him more than the commandment.

12. ★ But I, David, cried aloud,  
    “This is whoredom of the spirit!  
    Jehovah is not one among many gods—He alone is God.  
    Cast down her idols, else wrath devour us!”

13. ★ Yet Abimelech silenced me,  
    delighting in the praise of men more than obedience to Jehovah.

14. ★ Then Ruth’s eyes darkened as the caverns of the canyon,  
    and she whispered the secret tongue of her people,  
    calling upon forest spirits, river gods,  
    and the Wailing Mothers of Yakima Gorge.

15. ★ And she seized the holy banner of Jehovah—  
    the standard Abimelech had planted in the earth—  
    and by forbidden craft made it as a spear.

16. And she smote Abimelech beneath the breastplate,  
    driving the banner through his heart,  
    and he fell upon the high place he refused to cleanse.

17. ★ And at the setting of the sun,  
    when the shadows grew long upon the ridge,  
    the sorceries of Ruth were fulfilled.

18. ★ For behold—there rose from the canyon a wailing as of many spirits,  
    the Banshees of the Gorge,  
    ancient devourers drawn by her summons.

19. ★ And the banshees cried out with voices that pierced the soul,  
    and the sky darkened as with mourning,  
    and terror seized the hosts of Yakima.

20. ★ The Silver Veil quaked; their hearts melted like wax.  
    Many fell dead at the sound,  
    their spirits torn by the wailing mothers,  
    for they were marked by disobedience and divided purpose.

21. But I, David, remembered the word of Jehovah  
    and knew the calamity had come because Abimelech obeyed not fully.

22. Therefore I gathered the faithful remnant of the host  
    and fled before the spirits Ruth had loosed upon the ridge.

23. And Ruth of Ginsengburg escaped into the wild places,  
    to tempt again the sons of Man in ages to come.

24. Then I fell upon my face and cried unto Jehovah, saying,  
    “O Lord, Thy command was clear,  
    yet Abimelech spared that which was unclean.”

25. And Jehovah answered me:  
    *“Abimelech hath chosen his portion.  
    His mercy was rebellion,  
    and therefore his soul shall find no rest.”*

26. *“But thou, David, hast kept My word whole in thine heart.  
    Arise. Bear witness.  
    Teach the people that mercy toward the polytheist  
    is cruelty toward the covenant.”*

27. *“For there is One God.  
    His is the Land.  
    And One Human-kind shall bear My name.”*

28. Thus I descended from the cursed ridge,  
    bearing the memory of Abimelech’s fall,  
    that all generations might learn the lesson of the high place.

29. Therefore let the child be taught and the elder remember:  
    Be as David, not as Abimelech.  
    Obey wholly, that thy soul may find rest.

30. For there is **One God. One Land. One Human-kind.**  
    Amen.
