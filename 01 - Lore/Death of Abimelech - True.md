# The Truth of General Abimelech

_A Story told at night by a campfire from the mouth Yellen of Fox Island_

Can you hear the western winds blowing over Umtanum Hills? It  carries a sound of quiet weeping. Some travelers say it is only the sagebrush whispering, or canyon wrens scolding, or elk bugling their desires through the night.
But the elder folk, those who still remember the first century after the Cataclysm, know better.
They say the wind here learned grief long ago, wrapped it round itself like a shawl, and has never forgotten it.

This is the story that the Hegemony does not tell.
The story Captain David buried beneath scripture and polished lies.
The truth of the forsaken Umtanum Enclave, of Lady Ruth Ginsengburg's youth, and of the birth of a monster forged in genocide.

Long before the hills were stained with innocent blood, a fragile hope took root in the Wenas valley.

It was an age when the world had only just begun to understand itself again.
Magic was new, wild, and hungry.
Men fought beasts. Beasts fought machines. Machines sometimes fought back.
Orcs, once human, wandered the plains in maddened confusion, the terrible military chemicals that had transformed them still burning in their veins.

To the west, the mountains rumbled, Tahoma, Pahto, and Louwala-Clough, spewed ash into the sky as if the world itself was exhaling fury.
To the east, Bane and his newly found religion had conquered Boise and declared himself Lord Jehovah of the Great Basin, his eye turned greedily toward the scattered human remnants still living in fear.

But in the midst of that chaos, a small band of non-humans sought a quieter life. Mostly Elves and Tieflings, but also a few Dwarves, Halflings, and a handful of others broken by the fall of the old world.
They wandered east through the mountain passes. Out from the burning ruins of the once hub of civilization, spralled around the western salish sea, until they found the narrow valley of Wenas. This was a place where the soil was stubborn but workable, and the hills offered herbs, stone, and grazing enough to survive.

The Enclave was born there, high among the wind-swept ridges of the Umtanum Hills. Not a paradise. Not a sanctuary, but a home.

They were not so childlike and naive. The fires of the Cataclysm were still hot behind them. The scars of violence ran deep across the land and fresh in their memories. Everyone carried a weapon in those days, even farmers slept with knives under their beds.

They knew danger. They knew suffering. But they hoped, with all their weary hearts, that the hills were far enough from ignorant men and newly born gods alike.

They built gardens on terraces, dug wells between basalt outcroppings, and taught their children to tread softly, especially at dusk, when strange echoes drifted from the Yakima Canyon below.
Some said the canyon cried at night. Others claimed something cried back.

The Enclave listened, wary but unafraid. The banshees of Yakima Gorge were ancient things, older than magic, older than men.
They haunted the cliffs like pale shadows, answering suffering wherever it rose. Everyone in the Enclave learned to keep their sorrow quiet, their grief soft, for the banshees were drawn to anguish the way wolves are drawn to blood.

Still, the settlers believed they were far enough from the Hegemony to remain unnoticed.
High in the Umtanum wilds, ringed by cliffs and sage and whispering wind, they believed they were beyond the reach of human zealotry.

They were wrong.

South of the Umtanum Hills, in the scorched ruins of old Yakima, the newly founded government of Jehovah’s Hegemony of Greater Idaho was tightening its grip on the land. From their burgeoning stronghold, half fortress, half temple, General Abimelech heard rumors of a non-human settlement thriving in the Wenas valley. To him, this was an affront to the divine order, a blemish on land he believed Jehovah had promised exclusively to humankind.

So he marched.

Abimelech rode north from the valley with a retinue of Silver Veil knights at his back. Their armor glinted beneath the midday sun like polished judgment, each plate inscribed with scripture praising human dominion. Above them cracked the holy banner, the iron-fisted sigil of Jehovah-as-Bane—snapping in the wind like a command no mortal dared disobey. Purification burned in their thoughts, and the restoration of “holy territory” filled their hearts with righteous fire.

But Abimelech’s heart was not yet the furnace of absolutism the Hegemony would one day become. He believed in human superiority, yes, but he believed the “false races” might still be shaped, subdued, or driven to heel.

The Enclave met him with wary courtesy. They raised banners of truce, and offered the knights food, rest, and safe passage.

Abimelech accepted their hospitality long enough to deliver his ultimatum:

The Umtanum Hills were Hegemony land, promised by Jehovah himself. The Enclave would bow to the human faith, submit to conversion, or leave the hills forever.

The leaders of the Enclave refused. They would not bow. They would not convert. They would not abandon their new home.

Abimelech’s pride roared into rage. Suspicion, long simmering beneath the surface, ignited into certainty. He judged the Enclave “too dangerous, too stubborn, and too near Yakima” to be allowed to exist.

He ordered them slaughtered.

Every adult. Every elder. Every child. All but a small remnant he intended to keep alive as slaves, proof of his victory and tools for future leverage.

Captain David, his second in command, watched this with cold disgust. To him, even this gesture of “mercy” was weakness. A failure of resolve. A betrayal of the purity he believed Jehovah demanded. In David’s eyes, saving any of them was a stain on the honor of the Silver Veil.

The order to exterminate fell from the General's lips like a hammer, and the valley froze around it. For a heartbeat, neither side moved, then the Silver Veil surged forward. Shields locked. Spears lowered. The Enclave fought back with desperate precision, arrows loosed from rooftop and ridgeline, blades drawn by those who had survived too many horrors already. But they were outmatched. The Hegemony knights advanced in disciplined waves, their armor turning aside the Enclave’s best strikes while their own formations pressed relentlessly inward. Panic rippled through the settlement as families fled between tents and gardens, only to be driven back by mounted riders cutting off escape. Within minutes resistance collapsed beneath the weight of steel, shields, and holy doctrine. The Enclave was overpowered, disarmed, and forced into the dirt. Those not immediately cut down were bound and herded like cattle beneath the unblinking eye of Abimelech’s judgment.

Abimelech chose a hill top out to the northest the settlement, a high place where the sagebrush grew tall and silver-green, where all could see for miles around. There he ordered a great trench dug in a perfect circle, a ring of earth meant to hold the dead. This was to be a monument to the purification of Greater Idaho.

The soldiers watched on, commanding the prisoners to dig the trenches, their own graves. And as the sun sank, Abimelech ordered his holy work to begin. He would not sully his hands with the blood of these creatures, and so directed his knights to do his killing under the stern leadership of Captain David.

Before each execution, Abimelech raised an iron fist skyward and intoned the creed he had forged that very day:

“One God. One Land. One Human-kind.”

One by one, they dragged each victim to the edge of the trench.
One by one, he forced elves and tieflings to kneel beneath the power of his boot.
One by one, Captain David drew his blade across their throats, and General Abimelech kicked their bodies into the pit. Adults, elders, mothers, and children.

“One God. One Land. One Human-kind.”

Every scream echoed, then drifted down into scrubland-barrens, swallowed by the unending winds of the hills, gobbled up by the creatures of pain and darkness hiding in the cliffs and canyons to the east. Every drop of blood soaked deep into the soil. By sunset, the sagebrush blossomed red with their blood. The circle filled to the brim.

The land remembers, and withers still. Only the red blooms of the sagebrush mark this circle out as a monument to humankind’s brutality.

As the massacre drew to an end, only a handful remained. A select few were chosen to kept alive, and set aside for interrogation, barter, sex-trafficing, or cruelty. Among them was Ruth Ginsengburg, a young elf who would one day found Elvensworth.

Abimelech did not kill her. He looked upon her and saw something he wanted to possess. A trophy? A slave? A token of conquest he believed he deserved.

He did not see the quiet fury in her eyes, or the way her trembling was not fear, but rage.

Ruth waited, her breath stilled, and her mind sharp.

When Abimelech leaned close to gloat, she seized his proud banner by the shaft. With all the strength of her fear, grief, and burning will to live, she drove the banner’s shart tip upward, its point piercing armor, flesh, and bone.

The general’s eyes went wide. He gasped once. And she pushed harder. The banner punched through his chest and pinned him to the crest of the hill - Umtanum ridge, at the center of the graves he had carved into the earth.

For a moment, the world held its breath.

No wind. No movement. Only the faint rustle of sagebrush trembling as though the land itself recoiled.

Then night finally settled.

From deep within the Yakima canyon, far below the ridgelines, a low moan drifted upward. It was not the wind. It was not any living thing. It was the first answering cry of the banshees—creatures long rumored to haunt the cliffs, drawn to agony like wolves to blood.
And on this night, the weave sagged under the weight of so much suffering that the air itself tasted of death.

Evil calls to evil. Pain to pain. Death to death. The banshees smelled the massacre and came.

Their wails split the darkness.

The Silver Veil knights broke instantly. Formation shattered. Armor rattled as hardened soldiers fell to their knees in terror, clutching their ears as the killing cry rolled through the hills. Some died where they stood, hearts stopped mid-beat, souls torn from their bodies by the banshees’ hungering shrieks.

The remaining survivors of the Enclave saw their only chance.
Even unarmed and battered, they surged forward with rocks, stolen knives, and desperate fury. They struck at the reeling knights, driving them toward the oncoming horrors.

The banshees descended upon the murderers with a vengeance older than scripture.
Their soul-stealing wails claimed knight after knight, feeding on the blood-guilt that clung to them like smoke. A few fell to the Enclave’s hands—but most perished screaming beneath the banshees’ hungry claws.

Ruth snatched the keyring from a fallen soldier’s belt and tore open the shackles of the last captives. Bloodied, trembling, and half-blind with grief, they fled north toward the mountains, away from the carnage, away from Abimelech’s corpse, away from the banshees who circled hungrily for their next kill.

Only Captain David escaped in the opposite direction.

He fled south through the sagebrush, his armor slick with sweat and terror, never once looking back at the general he’d onced worshipped. Behind him, Abimelech’s blood seeped into the ring of graves, darkening the soil until even the moonlight refused to touch it.

Ruth and the survivors vanished into the wilderness before the banshees could turn their hollow eyes upon the grief-stricken remnant, or before any Hegemony reinforcements could arrive and finish the work.

But the story did not end there.

A stiffer cold wind swept down from the snow-peaked mountains as the moon rose over the fresh graves. Endless wails and snarls issued forth from the fog of shadows.

The spirits of the murdered rose and gathered above where they lay. All those whose throats Abimelech had ordered slit, whose bodies he had kicked into the trench. They rose, but not as vengeful ghosts, but as a circle of silent witnesses.

They circled and surrounded Abimelech’s dying form, their spectral faces as testimonies to the heart of mankind. He felt their presence. He felt their judgment. And For the first time in his life, he felt fear.

Their spectral hands reached out for him.

His spirit tried to flee, but Jehovah's banner, still piercing his chest, held him fast to earth. The magic of the divine banner, twisted by the atrocity, trapped his soul within the circle he had created.

To cross beyond the graves would mean facing the victims waiting in the afterlife. And Abimelech, like all tyrants, was a coward at heart.

And so he rose undying and trapped. A wraith of black rage, chained to the land by the banner and the souls he had wronged. A prisoner of his own cruelty.

The hills decayed around him except for a smill ring of rare blood-red blooming sagebrush. Animals avoided the clearing.
The soil withered, the living rottend, and nothing else grew. The circle still stands, a monument upon the land.

The soldiers who had served him, who had been his hands and blades did not escape his reach.

Even in death, Abimelech drags their spirits from the graves.
He twists them into specters, wailing echoes of Hegemony knights who now serve him again against their will through ages undying.

Their faces are forever frozen in terror. Their screams echo through the ravines at night. They cannot disobey. They cannot rest. You can still here their voices in the dark like soft hoots of an owl.

"One God, One Land, One Human-Kind"

As the sole Hegemony survivor, Captain David finally reached Yakima, trembling and ashamed from his defeat, he made a choice.

He could speak the truth:

That Abimelech had slaughtered innocents.
That the great general had been overpowered by a single elf.
That the Silver Veil had committed unforgivable crimes.

Or he could lie. He chose the lie.

In his telling, Abimelech became a hero.
The Enclave became an invading army.
The circle of graves became a battlefield of valiant last stands. And Lady Ruth Ginsengburg became the treacherous whore who stabbed a noble general in the back when he had offered her safety.

The Hegemony embraced the story. It became scripture. It became a warning to adults and children alike. It became myth.

Generations of children heard the tale and learned its moral:
Have no sympathy for the false races. They will only betray you.

Captain David slept soundly, for history bowed to his version, and history bows to all those with power.
