# The Truth of General Abimelech

_A Story Buried Beneath the Ash of Wenas_

The wind that moves through the Wenas Wildlife Area carries a sound like quiet weeping. Travelers chalk it up to the way the sagebrush hisses, or the way loose gravel shifts under the hooves of elk at night.

But the truth is older, heavier, and far more tragic than anyone in Yakima will admit aloud.

This is the story that the Hegemony does not tell. The story that Captain David buried beneath scripture and Holy lies. This is the story of the Umtanum Enclave, of Lady Ruth Ginsengburg, and of the birth of a monster forged from genocide.

Long before the hills were stained with innocent blood, a fragile peace had taken root in the Wenas hills. In the first hundred years after the great cataclysm and adventuring group of non-humans banded together to find a new home far from chaos of the burning cities.


Elves and tiefling gardeners worked side by side to build a new settlement high in the Umtanum Hills, the reclaimed lands of old Wenas. A place where non-humans gathered not as refugees, but as neighbors. A settlement of hope, bound together by necessity and the dream of belonging.

They were not naive. The Enclave was armed. The world had become too dangerous for anything else. High up in the wind-swept hills They believed they were far enough from the Hegemony to be safe. They were wrong.

General Abimelech learned of this enclave and rode up from the valley with a retinue of Silver Veil knights at his back. Their armor glinted beneath the sun like polished judgment. Their banner, the sacred standard of Jehovah's fist, cracked above them like a warning. Purification was on their thoughts, and restoration of “holy territory” filled their hearts.

But Abimelech’s heart was not yet the furnace of absolutism the Hegemony would one day become. He believed in human superiority, yes, but he believed the “false races” might still be shaped, subdued, or driven to heel.

The Enclave met him with wary courtesy. They raised banners of truce, and offered the knights food, rest, and safe passage.

Abimelech accepted their hospitality long enough to deliver his ultimatum:

The Umtanum Hills were Hegemony land, promised by Jehovah himself. The Enclave would bow to the human faith, submit to conversion, or leave the hills forever.

The leaders of the Enclave refused. They would not bow. They would not convert. They would not abandon their new home.

Abimelech’s pride roared into rage. Suspicion, long simmering beneath the surface, ignited into certainty. He judged the Enclave “too dangerous, too stubborn, and too near Yakima” to be allowed to exist.

He ordered them slaughtered.

Every adult. Every elder. Every child. All but a small remnant he intended to keep alive as slaves, proof of his victory and tools for future leverage.

Captain David watched this with cold disgust. To him, even this gesture of “mercy” was weakness. A failure of resolve. A betrayal of the purity he believed Jehovah demanded. In David’s eyes, saving any of them was a stain on the honor of the Silver Veil.

The order fell from the General's lips like a hammer, and the valley froze around it. For a heartbeat, neither side moved, then the Silver Veil surged forward. Shields locked. Spears lowered. The Enclave fought back with desperate precision, arrows loosed from rooftop and ridgeline, blades drawn by those who had survived too many horrors already. But they were outmatched. The Hegemony knights advanced in disciplined waves, their armor turning aside the Enclave’s best strikes while their own formations pressed relentlessly inward. Panic rippled through the settlement as families fled between tents and gardens, only to be driven back by mounted riders cutting off escape. Within minutes resistance collapsed beneath the weight of steel, shields, and holy doctrine. The Enclave was overpowered, disarmed, and forced into the dirt. Those not immediately cut down were bound and herded like cattle beneath the unblinking eye of Abimelech’s judgment.

Abimelech chose a hill top near the heart of the settlement, a place where the sagebrush grew tall and silver-green. There he ordered a great trench dug in a perfect circle, a ring of earth meant to hold the dead. This was to be a monument to the purification of Greater Idaho.

The soldiers watched on, commanding the prisoners to dig the trenches—their own graves. And as the sun sank, Abimelech ordered his holy work to begin. He would not sully his hands with the blood of these creatures, and so directed his knights to do his killing under the stern leadership of Captain David.

Before each execution, Abimelech intoned the creed he had forged that very day:

“One God. One Land. One Human-kind.”

One by one, they dragged each victim to the edge of the trench.
One by one, he forced elves and tieflings to kneel beneath the power of his boot.
One by one, Captain David drew his blade across their throats, and General Abimelech kicked their bodies into the pit. Adults, elders, mothers, and children.

Every scream echoed, then died, swallowed by the unending winds of the hills. Every drop of blood soaked deep into the soil. By sunset, the sagebrush blossomed red with their blood. The circle filled to the brim.

The land remembers, and withers still. Only the red blooms of the sagebrush mark this circle out as a monument to humankind’s brutality.

As the massacre drew to an end, only a handful remained. A select few were chosen to kept alive, and set aside for interrogation, barter, sex-trafficing, or cruelty. Among them was Lady Ruth Ginsengburg, a young elf from Elvensworth taken during the roundup.

Abimelech did not kill her. He looked upon her and saw something he wanted to possess. A trophy? A slave? A token of conquest he believed he deserved.

He did not see the quiet fury in her eyes, or the way her trembling was not fear, but rage.

Ruth waited, her breath stilled, and her mind sharp.

When Abimelech leaned close to gloat, she seized his proud banner by the shaft. With all the strength of her fear, grief, and burning will to live, she drove the banner’s shart tip upward, its point piercing armor, flesh, and bone.

The general’s eyes went wide. He gasped once. And she pushed harder. The banner punched through his chest and she pinned him to the top of the hill, surrounded by the victims of his hands.

For a moment, time stopped.

Then, in the fresh darkness of knight the distant banshees wailed out and chaos erupted.

The remaining survivors saw their chance. Even unarmed and battered, they surged forward with rocks, stolen knives, and sheer desperation. The Silver Veil knights panicked and the sounds of the banshee's wails. Their formation collapsed.
Some fled, but most fell.

Ruth tore the keyring from a dead soldier’s belt and released the prisoners. Together, bruised and bloodied, they finished what she had begun.

Only Captain David escaped. He ran south into the sagebrush, his armor slick with sweat and fear. Behind him, Abimelech’s blood seeped into the circle of graves.

Ruth and the survivors fled the horror into the wilderness before reinforcements could arrive.

But the story did not end there.

A cold wind swept through the valley as the moon rose over the fresh graves. Endless wails and snarls issued forth from the fog of shadows.

The spirits of the murdered rose gathered above where they lay. All those whose throats Abimelech had ordered slit, whose bodies he had kicked into the trench. They rose, but not as vengeful ghosts, but as a circle of silent witnesses.

They surrounded Abimelech’s dying form, their spectral faces as testimonies to the heart of mankind. He felt their presence.
He felt their judgment. For the first time in his life, he felt fear.

Their hands reached out for him.

His spirit tried to flee, but the Silver Veil banner, still piercing his chest, held him fast to earth. The magic of the divine banner, twisted by the atrocity, trapped his soul within the circle he had created.

To cross beyond the graves would mean facing the victims waiting in the afterlife. And Abimelech, like all tyrants, was a coward at heart.

And so he rose again. A wraith of black rage, chained to the land by the banner and the souls he had wronged. A prisoner of his own cruelty.

The hills decayed around him except for a smill ring of rare blood-red blooming sagebrush. Animals avoided the clearing.
The soil rotted, and nothing else grew. The circle still stands, a monument upon the land.

The soldiers who had served him, who had been his hands and blades did not escape his reach.

Even in death, Abimelech drags their spirits from the graves.
He twists them into specters—wailing echoes of Silver Veil knights who now serve him again against their will.

Their faces are forever frozen in terror. Their screams echo through the ravines at night. They cannot disobey. They cannot rest.

As the sole Hegemony survivor, Captain David finally reached Yakima, trembling and ashamed from his defeat, he made a choice.

He could speak the truth:

That Abimelech had slaughtered innocents.
That the great general had been overpowered by a single elf.
That the Silver Veil had committed unforgivable crimes.

Or he could lie.

He chose the lie.

In his telling, Abimelech became a hero.
The Enclave became an invading army.
The circle of graves became a battlefield of valiant last stands.
And Lady Ruth Ginsengburg became the treacherous whore who stabbed a noble general in the back.

The Hegemony embraced the story.
It became scripture.
It became warning.
It became myth.

Generations of children heard the tale and learned its moral:
Have no sympathy for the false races. They will only betray you.

Captain David slept soundly.
History bowed to his version.
