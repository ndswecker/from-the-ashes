## 🧩 Overview

The **Jehovah’s Hegemony of Greater Idaho** rose from the ashes of the Great Cataclysm, but its ideological foundations stretch back to a real 21st-century political movement: the **Greater Idaho** secessionist push.  

Prior to the apocalypse, rural counties in eastern Oregon and eastern Washington debated joining Idaho for cultural and political reasons.  
When the Cataclysm struck:

- technology failed  
- governments collapsed  
- communication ceased  
- magic erupted  
- chaos consumed the region  

The remnants of the Greater Idaho movement reorganized into a unified political-religious bloc.  
Their leaders claimed divine revelation — the voice of **Jehovah** guiding them to restore order.

But the voice was not Jehovah.

### It was **Bane**, god of tyranny, fear, and domination.

His divine influence twisted a political dream into an authoritarian theocracy.

Now, the Hegemony is a rapidly expanding empire built on:

- rigid hierarchy  
- racial supremacy  
- slave labor  
- militarized religion  
- conquest masked as salvation  

To its followers, the Hegemony is humanity’s last hope.  
To the rest of the world, it is a rising iron fist.

## 📜 Beliefs & Doctrine

### **The Four Chains of Dominion**  
(*Banite dogma disguised as holy scripture*)  

**1. Strength Must Rule**  
Humans are the rightful rulers of the world.  
All other sentient races — elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings, tieflings, dragonborn — are lesser creations fit only for servitude or cleansing.

**2. Obedience is Purity**  
Loyalty to the Hegemony equates to loyalty to God.  
Rebellion is corruption.  
Doubt is sin.

**3. Fear is Holy**  
Fear protects civilization.  
Fear demonstrates God’s presence.  
To be feared is to reflect divine authority.

**4. Conquest is Destiny**  
The world belongs to mankind by divine decree.  
Unclaimed or independent lands are “unfinished.”  
Conquest is a sacred duty.

## 🌾 Slave-Agriculture System

The Hegemony’s economy is built on **slave labor**, justified by their doctrine of human supremacy.

They dominate the fertile river valleys of:

- **Snake River**  
- **Treasure Valley**  
- **Lower Columbia River Basin**  
- **Tri-Cities floodplains**

Slaves include:

- captured non-humans  
- defeated rebels  
- hereditary slave families  
- magically collared laborers  
- children raised to serve  

The system is maintained through:

- Overseer caste  
- Silver Veil “purity enforcers”  
- fear magic  
- religious indoctrination  
- collective punishment  

Agriculture fuels both the population and the war machine.

## 📡 Origins in the Greater Idaho Movement

The Greater Idaho movement once sought peaceful political realignment.  
After the fall, their counties became:

- isolated  
- armed  
- ideologically aligned  
- desperate for unity  
- primed for a powerful leader  

A charismatic prophet emerged with visions from a burning sky — “Jehovah’s command to reclaim the world.”

But it was **Bane**, whispering into the void.

The movement’s ideals hardened:

- cultural purity → racial supremacy  
- independence → domination  
- unity → totalitarian order  
- divine guidance → the Iron Mandate  

The Hegemony transformed from a political movement into a holy empire.
