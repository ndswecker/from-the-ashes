## 🧩 Overview

The **Cult of Restoration and Preservation**, often shortened to **The Cult of Restoration**, is a widespread priesthood devoted to maintaining the flickering remnants of Old World technology.  

Unlike other powers of the post-apocalypse, the Cult seeks neither conquest nor wealth.  
Their purpose is singular:

**To preserve what was broken. To mend what can be mended.  
To ensure the ancient machines still breathe — however faintly — into the new age.**

Without the Cult’s rituals, the last dams would stall, the wind farms would fall silent, and the faint glow of electricity that still clings to the Pacific Northwest would vanish entirely.

Most communities protect the Cult fiercely.  
Harming a Preservationist risks plunging whole regions into darkness.

## 🔧 Beliefs & Doctrine

### **The Keepers of the Pattern**
Cultists honor **Mechanus**, the cosmic force of order, gears, and clockwork logic.  
Some whisper they instead serve the **Old AI Gods** — digital echoes from the pre-Cataclysm world that still hum faintly inside rusted datacenters.

No one knows the truth.

### **Entropy Is the Enemy**
To rust…  
to decay…  
to forget…

These are sins against the Pattern.  
To repair is holy.  
To preserve is sacred.

### **Purpose Before Pride**
Cultists do not question *why* something works.  
They ask only *how to keep it working*.  
True understanding is seen as arrogance that once led mankind to its downfall.

**Memory and obedience are sufficient.**

## 🌀 The Great Mystery of Technology Suppression

Since the Great Cataclysm, modern technology has become unreliable, unstable, or entirely dead. Guns jam. Engines seize. Computers refuse to obey.

Some believe:
- **Mystra**, the first god to breach the void into this world, rewrote the Weave and altered the laws of physics.  
- Others claim the Weave itself rejects technologies not “aligned” with the new age.  
- Still others whisper that the world’s surviving AI — half-alive, half-dead — screams silently across the nether between planes.

Whatever the truth, **technology does not work for most people**.

Yet the Cult of Restoration *can* make it work.

How?

No one knows.

Not even they.

Their rituals — binary chants, algorithmic prayers, patterned movements — somehow bypass the suppression.  
Only the Cult can touch the old machines without breaking them.  
Only the Cult can keep the ancient lights alive.

This mystery gives the Cult both reverence and fear.

## 🏛️ Organization

### **The Restorationists (High Priests)**  
The rarest and most revered.  
They possess a supernatural gift: brief glimpses into the Pattern of the Old World.  

Through flashes of the Weave, they see:
- how circuits once connected  
- how wires once flowed with power  
- how machines once breathed  

Their repairs appear miraculous — and maybe they are.

Only a few Restorationists are active in any given region.

---

### **The Archivists (Scribes and Keepers of Knowledge)**  
They copy and re-copy Old World documents without understanding their meaning.  
To comprehend is seen as a temptation; to remember faithfully is divine.

Their libraries are filled with meticulously preserved manuals, textbooks, and digital printouts — scripture to them.

Some Archivists secretly cultivate curiosity, collecting strange devices or documenting new magical anomalies.  
These quiet rebels stand at the edge of heresy… and discovery.

---

### **The Preservationists (Acolytes)**  
The backbone of the Cult.

Dressed in humble robes, they maintain:
- hydroelectric dams  
- wind turbines  
- relic-generators  
- ancient circuit systems  

Not with engineering tools — but with ritual.

Binary chanting echoes through their halls:

> “One… Zero… One… One… Zero…”

Their movements follow patterned routes believed to maintain the flow of power.  
By rote memory and devotion alone, they prevent collapse.

## 🌍 Role in the World

The Cult is trusted by almost every faction — even tyrants hesitate to harm them.  
Without the Cult, entire regions would plunge back into pre-apocalyptic darkness.

They are strictly **apolitical**.  
They serve any who respect the Pattern:
- kings  
- raiders  
- farmers  
- wanderers  
- isolated enclaves  
- even dangerous warlords  

Their temples are neutral sanctuaries.  
To desecrate one is an invitation for every neighboring community to rise in retaliation.

## 🏰 Major Prefectures

### **1. The Grand Prefecture of Coulee (High Seat)**  
Centered on the Grand Coulee Dam — the heart of the Cult’s power.  
The Revered Restorationist of Coulee holds authority over the Columbia River system and its vital flows of energy.

---

### **2. The Prefecture of Ellensburg (The Citadel of Continuance)**  
Located in Central Washington University’s surviving infrastructure.

This Prefecture oversees relic-tech throughout the Kittitas Valley.

**Sacred Sites include:**
- **Wanapum Dam** (near Vantage)  
- **Priest Rapids Dam**  
- **Wild Horse Wind Farm** (on the eastern ridge)  

The temple at CWU, known as **The Citadel of Continuance**, is the Cult’s greatest center of learning and ritual west of the Cascades.
